Given a binary tree with n nodes and a non-negative integer k, the task is to count the number of special nodes.
A node is considered special if there exists at least one leaf in its subtree such that the distance between the node and leaf is exactly k.

Note: Any such node should be counted only once. For example, if a node is at a distance k from 2 or more leaf nodes, then it would add only 1 to our count.

Example 1:

Input:
Binary tree
        1
      /   \
     2     3
   /  \   /  \
  4   5  6    7
          \ 
          8
k = 2
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
There are only two unique nodes that are at a distance of 2 units from the leaf node. (node 3 for leaf with value 8 and node 1 for leaves with values 4, 5 and 7) Note that node 2 isn't considered for leaf with value 8 because it isn't a direct ancestor of node 8.
Example 2:

Input:
Binary tree
          1
         /
        3
       /
      5
    /  \
   7    8
         \
          9
k = 4
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
Only one node is there which is at a distance of 4 units from the leaf node.(node 1 for leaf with value 9) 
Your Task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Complete the function printKDistantfromLeaf() that takes root node and k as inputs and returns the number of nodes that are at distance k from a leaf node. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree).

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
